## My Final App
### Kari Swimelar
### CIS-277-H010

My app will take the weekly hours worked and hourly rate for the employee and calculate the Gross Pay, any Overtime pay, taxes and net pay.
The start of the app askes for the Employee ID, Hours Worked and Houry Pay. The app writes that date to a file and then askes if you want to continue. If continue "Y" is chosen, the app asks for next employee information, if continue "N" is chosen, the app displays the employee data on the screen.

The App creats the file employee.txt and writes the employee ID, Hours worked and Pay Rate to the file. When finished entering the employee data, the program prints out the results with the headers:
EMP ID:  HOURS: RATE: OVERPAY:  GROSSPAY: TAX:  NETPAY:  

Taxes are calculated from the gross pay: 
10% for 0 - 999 
20% for 1000 - 2999
30% for 3000 - 3999
40% for 4000 and greater.

I would like to write the data to an Excel Spreadsheet and have the option to save the data calculated to a spreadsheet or to print off the calculated data. 

There are a number of ways that the program can be modified. This is just the start and can be changed to meet the needs of managers or payrole.
